RiskEngine — transparent weighted fusion of all risk signals (§8).

PROTOTYPE: the weights below are transparent placeholders, NOT scientifically
validated — say that out loud to judges. FUTURE PRODUCT: replace with a
calibrated classifier (logistic regression / gradient boosting) trained on
labelled data. This class is isolated on purpose so that swap touches
nothing else in the app (§8).
